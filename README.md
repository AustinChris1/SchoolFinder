## Project Overview

School Finder Abuja is a web application designed to help users efficiently locate and filter schools in Nigeria. The application provides a seamless and fast user experience by employing modern data-fetching and state-management techniques.

## Key Features

* **Filter by School Level**: Users can easily filter schools by their level, including Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary.
* **Instant Filtering**: Thanks to a "fetch-once-and-cache" strategy, the app loads all school data on initial page load, eliminating network delays when a user switches between school levels. This provides a fast and responsive interface.
* **Intuitive Interface**: The application is built to be simple and easy to use, allowing users to find the information they need without any hassle.

## Technology Stack

* **React**: The project is built with React for a component-based and efficient user interface.
* **JavaScript (JSX)**: The core logic and components are written in JavaScript with JSX syntax.
* **JSON**: School data is stored and fetched from local JSON files, which is central to the application's performance.
